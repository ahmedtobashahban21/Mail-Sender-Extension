# Mail Sender Project

## Introduction

Hello everyone,

Here's the latest update on my Mail Sender project. I have developed a web application with Angular for the frontend and .NET for the backend. This extension web application features a single interactive page that allows you to send emails to companies when job hunting or to contact individuals you wish to reach.

## Features

- **Interactive Frontend:** Built with Angular, providing an easy-to-use form for sending emails.
- **Robust Backend:** Developed with .NET, handling email sending functionality.
- **Single Page Application:** Simplifies the process of composing and sending emails in one place.

## How to Use

1. **Frontend:** The Angular application provides a form where you can enter the recipient's email, subject, and message body. You can also attach files if needed.
2. **Backend:** The .NET backend processes the email sending request, using MimeKit and MailKit to handle the SMTP configuration and send the email.
